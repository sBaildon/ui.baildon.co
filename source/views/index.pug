			section#about
				h2 About
				p.
					sInterface is an opinionated replacement for the standard BlizzardUI.
					Reductionism is the goal. Fewer, smaller elements; frames that show
					when required; key information in the spotlight.

				p.
					Supported configuration is minimal, and only available by editing lua files.
					sInterface has no concept of character profiles, configuration is shared
					between all characters without any setup.
