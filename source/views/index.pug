			section#about
				h2 About
				p.
					sInterface is an opinionated replacement for the standard BlizzardUI. Reductionism is the goal. Fewer, smaller elements; frames that show when required; key information in spotlight.

				p.
					Supported configuration is minimal, and only available with lua files. sInterface has no concept of character profiles, configuration is shared between all characters without any setup. If you want to configure sInterface you will need to use a text editor to change the files found in #[code config/], save,  then reload your UI in game with #[code /reload].
